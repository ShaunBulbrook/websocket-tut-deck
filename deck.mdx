- Added to the HTML5 specification by Ian Hickson in 2008.
- Google releases the first Websocket implementation in Chrome 4 (December 2009)
# And the point is?
Any operation where we need the server (or other recepticle) to talk to the browser, without the browser pestering for an update!

# Using Websockets

_Your turn..._
---
```bash
git clone ***
npm install socket.io-client --save
```
---
First, import the socket.io client to your component...

```javascript
import io from 'socket.io-client';
//
this.socket = io(***:4001);
this.socket.emit('new message', {
	author: 'Your name',
	message: 'Your Message',
});
```

import ChatWindow from './components/ChatWindow';

<ChatWindow />

# The end
